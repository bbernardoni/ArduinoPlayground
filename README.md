# Arduino Playground
This repository contains a bunch of random projects for the arduino.

## Music
Plays simple monophonic music on a piezoelectric buzzer.
Music is stored as an array of pitches and an array of durations.
It is played by bit banging high and low on a digital output.

## Triangle DAC
Outputs a triangle wave of PWM values using the arduino's timer registers.

## Floppy Music
Another music player but instead of a piezoelectric buzzer is uses the
servo motor of a floppy drive.
